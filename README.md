# 🚀 Anime Search Engine with MyAnimeList API 🔍
## 🌟 Overview
The Anime Search Engine is a Python-based project that allows users to search for anime information using the MyAnimeList API. Whether you’re an anime enthusiast, a developer, or just curious about the latest shows, this project provides a convenient way to explore anime details.

## 📋 Features 
User-Friendly Interface: The command-line interface (CLI) makes it easy to search for anime titles and retrieve relevant information.
Search by Title: Users can input the name of an anime they want to explore, and the script fetches matching results from the MyAnimeList API.
Detailed Information: Once the search results are displayed, users can select an anime by its serial number. The script then retrieves detailed information, including the synopsis.
RapidAPI Integration: The project leverages the MyAnimeList API from RapidAPI for accurate and up-to-date data.
## 🤖 How It Works 
- Setup:
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
- Replace the placeholders for ‘X-RapidAPI-Key’ and ‘X-RapidAPI-Host’ in the script with your actual RapidAPI key and host.
- Run the Script:
- Execute the Python script (anime_search.py).
- Input the anime title you want to search for.
- Explore Anime Details;
      - View search results with titles and descriptions.
      - Select an anime by entering its serial number.
      - Get detailed information, including the synopsis.
## ⚠️ Limitations 
The script requires an environment that supports user input and external API calls.
Keep your RapidAPI key private to prevent misuse.
